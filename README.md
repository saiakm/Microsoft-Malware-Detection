# Microsoft-Malware-Detection
In the past few years malware attacks have grown exponentially both in frequency and
sophistication and challenged the traditional Intrusion detection systems.To successfully enforce
an efficient defense mechanism, the accurate classification of malware is required. In this
project we are going to build a Malware classification system by using Machine Learning
algorithms.To build this pipeline, we considered real time data set from kaggle competition
hosted by Microsoft

Data description
  ● Source : https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data
  ● For every malware, we have two files
    ● ".asm" file
    ● ".byte" file
  ● Total training dataset consists of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files
    and 150GB of data is .asm files:
  ● There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files
  ● There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our given data
  ● Types of Malware:
    ○ Ramnit
    ○ Lollipop
    ○ Kelihos_ver3
    ○ Vundo
    ○ Simda
    ○ Tracur
    ○ Kelihos_ver1
    ○ Obfuscator.ACY
    ○ Gatak
  ● The .byte files are the compiled form of .asm files. In this project, we considered only the
    resulting .byte file for analysis
  ● File id vs labels data is taken from the file trainLabels.csv
  
  NOTE: In this project we are working on only on the .bytes files which is 50Gb of data.
